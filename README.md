## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/airdropinsiders/TheVapeLabs-Auto-Bot.git
   cd TheVapeLabs-Auto-Bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

##  3. Configuration your token

### Token Setup

There are two ways to set up your VapeLabs tokens (option 1 worked well for me):

#### Option 1: Using tokens.txt file (Recommended)

Create a `tokens.txt` file by used command `nano tokens.txt` in the root directory and add one token per line :

```
token1_here
token2_here
token3_here
```
- press ctrl+x 
- press ctlr+y+enter
#### Option 2: Using .env file

Create a `.env` file by used command `nano .env` in the root directory and add your tokens:
- press ctrl+x 
- press ctlr+y+enter

```
TOKEN_1=your_first_token_here
TOKEN_2=your_second_token_here
TOKEN_3=your_third_token_here
```

### Proxy Setup (Optional)

Create a `proxies.txt` file by used command `nano proxies.txt` in the root directory and add one proxy per line in the format `ip:port` or `ip:port:username:password`:
- press ctrl+x 
- press ctlr+y+enter

```
http://123.45.67.89:8080
http://username:password@ip:port
```
4. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## Usage

The bot features an interactive terminal UI:

- Use **Arrow Keys** (← →) to navigate between accounts
- Press **Q** to quit the bot

### Battery Tapping Logic

- When battery is **below 50%**, the bot will automatically tap (5 taps every 20 seconds) until it reaches 100%
- When battery is **100%**, the bot will wait until it drops below 50% to start tapping again
- When battery is **between 50% and 100%**, the bot will wait until it drops below 50%

## Troubleshooting

- If you're experiencing rate limiting (429 errors), consider:
  - Adding more proxies to `proxies.txt`
  - Increasing the delay between requests
